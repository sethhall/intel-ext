Bro Intel Framework Extensions (Bro v2.3+2.4)
=========================================

NOTE: This does not work on Bro 2.5+ because the extension
behavior is built in now.  Refer to the following blog post 
for more information:

  http://blog.bro.org/2016/12/the-intelligence-framework-update.html

These are some extensions for Bro 2.3's Intel framework.

  - The ability to extend the Intel log with the 
    Intel::extend_match event.  This also disables the
    normal intel.log and creates a file named intel_ext.log.

  - The ability to whitelist items with the new intel
    item field named "whitelist".  To use it, create a new
    intel file with an additional field named "whitelist"
    using the value "T".  That will cause the item to be 
    a whitelisted item and avoid logging it.
